"Magic Trick" code to find value of cards 

This code is based off a homework problem I had in Discrete Structures 1. The context for the code is this: There is a magician, an assistant, and a volunteer. The magician does not see the anything that the assitant or volunteer does and only comes out after the assistant and the volunteer finish their work. 

The assistant will choose a volunteer from the crowd that is watching the magic trick. The assistant will then have the volunteer choose 7 cards from a full deck. 5 of these cards will be visable to the magician 2 of them will be hidden and the magician will have to "guess" what values the 2 hidden cards are based off the other 5 cards. To assist the Magician the Assistant will reorganize the 5 cards into a specific order that will indicate what the value of other 2 cards are.
